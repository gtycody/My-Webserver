                    In the view of History, many people join the war for different reasons. But, I believe that people participated war because of three main reasons. First, people want to pursue wealth and status. Second, the man who have wife and children are fighting for their family. And the most important, they all believe they can build a new national by themselves. 

                    When American revolution started, some people join the war because they want get both wealth and status. In “The patriot” Benjamin Martin recruits his militia in a local bar. Most of people join him for their self-interest. Benjamin even said: “you can keep sales back to me the musk and gear any red coat you kill” to one man who is asking for bounty. In “The Alamo”, people who join the army can get 640-acre land, (a man says: “640 acres of you own choosing”. Lot of people is motivated by the land offered and participates revolution. 
                    
                    However, for the man who has wife and children, his family is the most important to him. However, when their family was hurt, they join the revolution to revenge by anger. In “The Patriot”, Benjamin Martin was a retired general. Who believes people should avoid war since war must cause death. In the west Virginia conference, he even says: “why we should replace a tyrant three thousand mile a way by three thousand tyrants a mile away”. But, when war approached his house his second son is killed by Britain general Tavington and his house is burned down. He picks up his weapons against Britain army. In addition, before married, Gabriel Martin tell his father that he started to understand why Benjamin declined to attend war at the beginning because he has his family now.

                    Besides personal interest and family most of people who join the revolution strongly believe that they should get their own nation which is control by people themselves. In “The patriot”, Occam, the African American slave, is enlisted as a militia by his master at beginning. However, after he gets himself freedom after one year in militia, he insists to stay in army and says: “I’m here now on my own accord.” (“The Patriot”) In “The Alamo” all people who are fighting against Santa Anna with faith “either victory or died” have deeply believed that There should be a new republic which is not control by anyone except themselves. When Sam Houston received letter from Alamo, he says “I will rise an army, we will relive the Alamo, but only after we have declare independence and create a government that can be legally recognized by all the nation in the world, that! Was what ever besieged by enemy in Alamo fighting for (“The Alamo”). The belief to create a new nation and faith of freedom also secure the success of these two revolution.
                    
                    Revolution is hard. However, victory is already secured by the people who are fight not only for themselves, their family but also for The new nation.
